## Loan Default Probability using Classification

This project predicts the probability of **loan default** using machine learning models.  
The notebook (`Loan default prob code.ipynb`) covers data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Loan default risk prediction is essential for banks and financial institutions. Using historical loan application data, this project applies classification algorithms to predict whether a borrower is likely to default.  

Key highlights:
- Handling missing values (median/mode imputation)  
- Encoding categorical features with `LabelEncoder`  
- Splitting dataset into training and test sets  
- Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Evaluating performance with confusion matrix, classification report, ROC-AUC, and ROC curves  
- Ranking customers by predicted probability of default
